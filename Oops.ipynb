What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n","-> OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects that contain\n","   both data (attributes) and methods (functions). It helps in modeling real-world entities and promotes code reusability, scalability, and modularity.\n","\n","\n","2. What is a class in OOP?\n","-> A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data)  \n","   and methods (functions) that the objects of the class will have. Example:\n","\n","class Car:\n","    def _init_(self, brand, model):\n","        self.brand = brand\n","        self.model = model\n","\n","\n","3. What is an object in OOP?\n","-> An object is an instance of a class. It encapsulates data and behavior  \n","   defined by the class. Example:\n","\n","my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n","\n","\n","4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","\n","-> Abstraction focuses on hiding complex implementation details and showing  \n","   only essential features.\n","\n","   Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods together and restricting access to some components for security.\n","\n","5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n","-> Dunder (double underscore) methods, such as _init, __str, and __add_,  \n","   provide special functionality in Python classes. Example:\n","\n","   def _str_(self):\n","      return f\"{self.brand} {self.model}\"\n","\n","\n","6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n","-> Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from\n","   another class (parent), promoting code reuse. Example:\n","\n","class Vehicle:\n","    def _init_(self, type):\n","        self.type = type\n","\n","class Car(Vehicle):\n","    pass\n","\n","\n","7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","-> Polymorphism allows different classes to define methods with the same name,\n","   enabling behavior variation. Example:\n","\n","class Dog:\n","    def sound(self):\n","        return \"Bark\"\n","\n","class Cat:\n","    def sound(self):\n","        return \"Meow\"\n","8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","-> Encapsulation is achieved using private attributes (prefix with __) and\n","   public methods for controlled access. Example:\n","\n","class BankAccount:\n","    def _init_(self):\n","        self.__balance = 0\n","    def deposit(self, amount):\n","        self.__balance += amount\n","\n","\n","9. What is a constructor in Python?\n","-> A constructor is a special method (_init_) called when an object is created.\n","   It initializes the object.\n","\n","\n","10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n","-> Class methods: Use the @classmethod decorator and can modify class state\n","   using cls.\n","\n","-> Static methods: Use the @staticmethod decorator and don’t access class or\n","   instance state.\n","\n","\n","11. What is method overloading in Python?\n","-> Python doesn't support method overloading explicitly. However, you can\n","   achieve it by providing default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n","\n","\n","12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n","-> Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific\n","   implementation of a method defined in the parent class.\n","\n","13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n","-> The @property decorator allows you to define methods that can be accessed\n","   like attributes.\n","\n","\n","14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","-> Polymorphism provides flexibility and promotes reusability, allowing objects\n","   to be treated uniformly despite differences in their behavior.\n","\n","\n","15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n","-> An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may have\n","   abstract methods that must be implemented by derived classes.\n","\n","\n","16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n","->.Code reuse\n","\n","  .Scalability\n","\n","  .Modularity\n","\n","  .Security\n","\n","\n","17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","-> Class variable: Shared across all instances of the class.\n","\n","   Instance variable: Unique to each instance.\n","\n","\n","18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","-> Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one class.\n","   Example:\n","\n","\n","\n","  class A: pass  \n","  class B: pass  \n","  class C(A, B): pass\n","\n","19. Explain the purpose of _str_ and _repr_ methods in Python.\n","-> _str_: Provides a human-readable representation of the object.\n","\n","   _repr_: Provides an official string representation for debugging.\n","\n","\n","20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n","-> The super() function allows access to the parent class’s methods.\n","\n","\n","21. What is the significance of the _del_ method in Python?\n","-> The _del_ method is called when an object is deleted or goes out of scope.\n","\n","\n","22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","-> @staticmethod: Doesn’t require self or cls.\n","\n","   @classmethod: Requires cls and can modify class-level attributes.\n","\n","\n","23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","-> Polymorphism works by overriding methods in child classes while maintaining  \n","   a uniform interface.\n","\n","\n","24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","-> Method chaining allows multiple methods to be called on the same object in a\n","   single statement.\n","\n","\n","25. What is the purpose of the _call_ method in Python?\n","-> The _call_ method makes an object callable like a function.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yVtP4XE9Gb-l"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical **Questions**"],"metadata":{"id":"6T_9WxPfJlW7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
